some cool resources, demos and resources for learning wasm with me :)

## intro

As web applications become increasingly complex, developers are turning to new technologies that can help them build faster, more efficient, and more secure applications. WebAssembly is one such technology that is gaining popularity for its ability to run high-performance code in web browsers at near-native speed.

In this repository, you'll find a variety of resources that can help you understand how WebAssembly works and how to use it in practice. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, our goal is to provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to start building fast and efficient web applications using WebAssembly.

## wasm

[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) (wasm) is a low-level bytecode for [a stack-based virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine). And it can be run on four major browsers, Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and WebKit. It was created to bring high-performance, low-latency computing to the web, making it possible to run complex applications in the browser with near-native performance.

## wasi

The WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) is a modular system interface for WebAssembly that provides an API to interact with the host environment in a secure and sandboxed way. It allows WebAssembly modules to run in different environments without modification, making it easier to develop portable and secure applications. With WASI, developers can access file systems, network interfaces, and other system resources, all while maintaining a strict separation between the module and the host environment. This makes it possible to run untrusted code securely within a trusted environment.
